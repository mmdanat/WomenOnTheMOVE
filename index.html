            <div class="box">
            
                <p>I am orginally from Albuquerque,NM and have been working for close to six years as a nurse.
                    The majoraity of my time, close to 5 years has been in the Intensive Care Unit. In the winter of 
                    2021 I decided to leave my home hospital and travel around the southwest. I spent a very hot 
                    summer in Phenoix, Arizona and then have found a love for Colorado that has kept me around. Now with 
                    some time off from nursing I am studing the art of wiriting code.
                
                
                
        
                </p>
            </div>

        <h1 id="Work">WORK</h1>
            <p>I started my carrer as a Neuro ICU nurse and now have ventured into Travel Nursing. After taking time off 
                to play I am now trying to learn computer programing. 
            </p>
        <h1 id="Play">PLAY</h1>
            <p>
            Just as much as I enjoy helping people I love to play.My play consists of Rock CLimbing, Highlining, Snowboarding and really
            anything that gets me outside. Lucky for me I am able to find big communites of poeple that love all of these sports as 
            much as I do. 
            My dogs much prefer the time I am outside over working. My 7 year old German shepard mix loves the 
            colorado snow and my 12 year old terrier mix loves the hot summers with a warm place to take a nap.
            </p>
